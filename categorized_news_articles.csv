Most parents probably wouldn’t let their kids go to bars and nightclubs where they could meet adults who might harm them.

The new study, to be presented at the conference, found that about 7% of children ages 10 through 18 who were treated for sexual assault at a California hospital between 2018 and 2023 said that social media had facilitated their communication with their perpetrator. When the researchers looked only at cases of sexual assault by perpetrators who weren’t related to their victims, the number was even higher: Twelve percent of the children said their communications with their perpetrator led to their sexual assault.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/28/health/kids-social-media-dangers-wellness/index.html,CNN,2024-09-29,science
Helene latest,"The Southeast is grappling with widespread devastation after Helene made landfall Thursday as the strongest hurricane on record to slam into Florida’s Big Bend region and tore through multiple states, killing at least 62 people, knocking out power to millions and trapping families in floodwaters. In hard-hit North Carolina, days of unrelenting flooding have turned roads into waterways, left many without basic necessities and strained state resources. Here’s the latest: • Over 60 dead across 5 states: Deaths have been reported in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and Virginia. At least 10 people are dead in North Carolina, a release from Gov. Roy Cooper’s office said Saturday evening. At least 23 are dead in South Carolina, including two firefighters in Saluda County, authorities said. In Georgia, at least 17 people have died, two of them killed by a tornado in Alamo, according to a spokesperson for Gov. Brian Kemp. In Florida, at least 11 people have died, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saturday, including several people who drowned in Pinellas County. One person died in Craig County, Virginia, in a storm-related tree fall and building collapse, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Friday. • Dozens unaccounted for amid communications outage: More than 60 people were unaccounted for Saturday evening in Buncombe County, North Carolina – which includes the city of Asheville – and over 150 search and rescue operations were underway. County Manager Avril Pinder called the storm “Buncombe County’s own Hurricane Katrina,” and officials said communication systems have been disrupted, with no cell phone service expected in the region for at least “several days.” Emergency call volumes are also exceedingly high, with the county receiving over 5,500 911 calls and conducting more than 130 swift water rescues between Thursday and Saturday morning. Over 20 air rescues were conducted early Saturday to the east in McDowell County, where the emergency center was also inundated with calls, many of which involved patients “entrapped with severe trauma, running out of oxygen or essential medical supplies.” Emergency response efforts are hampered by massive landslides, downed trees, power lines and severely flooded roads.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/29/weather/hurricane-helene-florida-georgia-carolinas-sunday/index.html,CNN,2024-09-29,health

Reinstate the classic alarm clock,"I have reinstated the alarm clock. An overlooked mechanism in today’s technologically-synced, your-phone-does-everything world, it tells the time, it wakes you up, it is decentralized from a phone. It is marvelous. Why? Because before I brought an analogue clock back into my bedroom I was averaging two hours and 56 minutes of screen time per week, and my phone told me this every Monday, moments after my alarm would sound.

Hezbollah: What weapons does it have? A visual guide,"Hezbollah is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. Backed by Iran and based in the eastern Mediterranean country of Lebanon, the Shiite Islamist group has been engaged in confrontations with Israeli forces on Lebanon’s southern border since October 8. Hezbollah first fired at Israel to protest the war in Gaza, demanding a ceasefire there as a condition to end its attacks. Cross-border hostilities have since escalated, culminating in the death of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an Israeli strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut. The cross-border conflict and recent developments have raised the specter of a regional conflagration and amplified intense diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. Though no match for Israel’s military might, Hezbollah’s increasingly sophisticated arsenal has the potential to inflict significant damage on Israel.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/24/middleeast/hezbollah-weapons-visuals-intl-dg/index.html,CNN,2024-09-29,sports

Nasrallah’s killing, in a huge set of Israeli airstrikes on his underground headquarters in Beirut on Friday, marks a significant escalation in the conflict between Israel and the Lebanon-based militant group, which has been firing on Israel since the start of its war against Hamas in Gaza. It is also the latest in a string of major blows to Hezbollah, which has now lost multiple commanders and was already reeling after pagers and walkie-talkies owned by its members exploded earlier this month, killing dozens and maiming thousands.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/29/middleeast/what-might-come-next-as-hezbollah-reels-from-nasrallahs-killing-and-israel-mulls-the-possibility-of-a-lebanon-ground-incursion/index.html,CNN,2024-09-29,general-What might come next as Hezbollah reels from Nasrallah killing? news

"Killing of Nasrallah is a key prize for Israel, but it’s too early to write off Hezbollah","﻿On Saturday, Hezbollah confirmed that its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is dead after Israel announced he was killed in an airstrike in Beirut on Friday. His death marks a major moment in recent Middle East history, but the long-term consequences are uncertain. It raises a key question: Do “decapitation strikes” killing the leaders of terrorist groups cripple them? The short answer is not really. Israel should know from its own history that such strikes don’t always succeed in crippling a militant group. In 2008, Israel killed Hezbollah’s military leader, Imad Mughniyeh, in Damascus, Syria, yet the group only gathered strength in the years that followed.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/29/politics/what-disables-terrorist-groups-nasrallah-hezbollah/index.html,CNN,2024-09-29,"general-Killing of Nasrallah is a key prize for Israel, but it’s too early to write off Hezbollah news"
Hezbollah leader’s killing creates another balancing act for Biden,"The death of Hassan Nasrallah has caught President Joe Biden in a bind: While no one in the White House shed any tears for the longtime Hezbollah leader, the Israeli airstrike that took him out has only worsened fears of an escalating conflict, something Biden says he’s actively working to avoid. In the immediate aftermath of the operation, Biden was quick to alert the public that he hadn’t received any advance warning and wasn’t involved. It was only 24 hours later, after both Israel and Hezbollah had confirmed Nasrallah was killed, that Biden released a carefully worded statement declaring the death a “measure of justice” but repeating that his “aim is to de-escalate.” For Biden, the moment amounts to another high-tension balancing act — this time, only six weeks before a US presidential election. Already at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the nearly yearlong war in Gaza, the president is now working to calm two fronts at a moment when his influence on Netanyahu’s decision-making appears to be at an all-time low.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/28/politics/biden-hezbollah-nasrallah-killing-netanyahu/index.html,CNN,2024-09-29,politics

What’s the latest news about the Trump-Harris race? It depends on who you ask,"Over the past week, Americans were more likely to hear news about former President Donald Trump than about Vice President Kamala Harris, according to The Breakthrough, a CNN polling project that tracks what average Americans are actually hearing, reading and seeing about the presidential candidates throughout the campaign. But after a spate of high-profile news that drew attention largely across the political spectrum — including the presidential debate and the first assassination attempt against Trump — this week’s data shows a significant divergence between what Democrats and Republicans each recalled hearing about the GOP nominee. Republicans focused more on the assassination attempt against the former president in Florida earlier this month, while Democrats continued to say they were hearing more about his baseless claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. In the most recent survey — conducted September 20-23 by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, three-quarters of Americans said they’d consumed at least some news about Trump, slightly outpacing the 69% who said the same about Harris.

Why you should reinstate the classic alarm clock,"I have reinstated the alarm clock. An overlooked mechanism in today’s technologically-synced, your-phone-does-everything world, it tells the time, it wakes you up, it is decentralized from a phone. It is marvelous. Why? Because before I brought an analogue clock back into my bedroom I was averaging two hours and 56 minutes of screen time per week, and my phone told me this every Monday, moments after my alarm would sound. And, every morning, while only trying to tap “snooze,” I’d be confronted by a flurry of notifications piling up behind one another like a card game of solitaire on the screen. My phone would tell me that my friends were feeling chatty last night with 34-plus Whatsapp messages; there would be Instagram alerts and dozens of emails from multiple accounts.

How the CDC tests wastewater for Covid — and what it found in your state,"New Covid-19 infections are no longer tracked or reported as closely as they were during the public health emergency.

To identify virus levels and larger trends, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relies on a large network of sampling sites at wastewater treatment facilities across the country. The monitoring network covers about 43% of the population. The process doesn’t precisely count the numbers of cases, and readings can vary based on sewage flows at a particular location or the characteristics of a given variant at a point in time.

These hyperreal drawings of trucks look just like photographs – and take up to 500 hours to make,"Andrew Holmes’ images of trucks on Californian highways are sun-drenched, saturated and sharp. Looking at the crystal clear snapshots, you can almost hear the roar of the engines, feel the heat reflected off shiny aluminum gas tanks, and smell the diesel pumped out of the exhausts. But these are not photographs: each hyperreal image is in fact a color pencil drawing, resulting from between 300 and 500 hours of careful construction. Now, Holmes’ works have been brought together in a book — “Gas Tank City” (Circa Press) — alongside a show of the same name at London’s Architectural Association (AA). Holmes trained as an architect: he attended the AA, and even worked with the late Richard Rogers in 1969, on designs for the Centre Pompidou in Paris. But Holmes has since made his name as a multimedia artist, who by his own admission has been dedicated to drawing since he was four years old. Having grown up in the English town of Bromsgrove, Holmes traveled to the US as a student, at first snapping photographs and drawing what he saw in New York City, before heading out to Los Angeles and southern California. He became entranced by the Interstate Highway System: “I discovered (it) was designed as a single object,” he explained over coffee in London. “It (was) 43,000 miles long (at the time of its original design in 1956) — the biggest object that’s ever been designed in the world.” In California, Holmes regularly got in his car and drove along the highways. This was the early 1970s. “In those days, driving was actually a pleasure,” he said, contrasting it to the increased traffic of more recent years. He would visit truck stops and simply observe: the gas stations, the vehicles, the roadside diners and their signs. Something about them reminded him of visiting the local train station as a child in England, and watching “these huge things belching steam” pull into the station. What he loves about trucks is a similar sensory overload: “The sound, the smell, the shiny aluminum, the size of the things.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/25/style/andrew-holmes-truck-drawings-gas-tank/index.html,CNN,2024-09-29,entertainment

Pakistan says police responsible for killing a doctor accused of blasphemy,"Multan, Pakistan — Pakistan’s government said Thursday that police had orchestrated the killing of a doctor who was in custody after he was accused of blasphemy.

The statement marks the first time the government has accused security forces of what the doctor’s family and rights groups have said amounted to an extrajudicial killing carried out by police.
