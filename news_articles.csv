A video published by the Israeli military on Saturday showed jets it said were used to carry out the attack carrying at least 15 2,000-pound bombs, including the US-made BLU-109, according to Trevor Ball, a former senior explosive ordnance technician for the US Army who reviewed the footage for CNN. The bombs, known colloquially as “bunker busters” for their ability to penetrate deep underground before they detonate, were also fitted with the US-made Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) – a precision guidance kit that converts unguided, or “dumb” bombs, into “smart” munitions that can precisely strike a target – according to Ball.

He had formed an extremist coalition government in November 2022 on the back of the 32 seats his Likud party secured in the 120-seat Knesset. After Hamas’ attack, a string of opinion polls suggested that were elections held, Likud would get just 17 seats, putting the government’s long-term survival in jeopardy. Nearly a year later, Netanyahu has staged a remarkable turnaround. Though Likud would still struggle to form a government were elections held today, a brutal campaign of airstrikes in Lebanon and assassinations across the Middle East in recent weeks have buoyed the prime minister to heights unimaginable in the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attacks almost a year ago.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/30/middleeast/israel-popularity-netanyahu-hezbollah-intl/index.html,CNN,2024-09-30

Total victory, however, is elusive, and those who get what they wish for often live to regret it. Since Sept 17, Israel has dealt the Iran-backed militant group one body blow after another in Lebanon — first the pager and walkie talkie blasts, then a massive air strike on southern Beirut which killed senior commander Ibrahim Aqil (along with at least two dozen civilians), followed three days later by the start of a brutal bombing campaign.

‘Who are you?’ An artist confronts photos of her father’s past lovers,"Do we ever really truly know our parents? As children, it’s often hard to imagine that they had full and complicated lives before us. Even as we get older some parts remain shrouded in mystery, their early romances and other unfollowed paths mere footnotes. London-based photographer Caroline Furneaux faced these questions after sifting through boxes of her father’s 35mm slides in the years following his sudden death in his 70s. She’d had a complex relationship with him, and felt as if his death in 2011 left things unresolved, she explained in a phone call. She let the archive sit for some time, expecting a familiar array of pictures taken during his compulsory national service, or perhaps his documentation of crop growth while working as an agronomist in Sweden. Instead, peering into her father’s handheld slide viewer, she found sun-kissed women she’d never seen, sitting in convertibles, posing on rocks at the beach or gathering wildflowers by the sea.

But a substantial number of Republican voters now identify as vaccine skeptics — and Trump rarely mentions what’s considered one of the great public health accomplishments in recent memory. “The Republicans don’t want to claim it,” Trump told an interviewer in late September.

What it’s like playing for the worst national soccer team in the world,"Losing 2-1 to Denmark. Falling 2-1 to Finland. Drawing 1-1 with Latvia. For most soccer teams, this would be an indication of bad form, difficult moments that supporters try their best to forget and probably a sign that the team is looking for a new coach. For San Marino, these are some of the greatest results in the nation’s history. That’s because San Marino loses – a lot. Since the country’s first ever match on March 28, 1986, of the 212 games the national team has played, it has lost all but 12 and only won two. The highest position La Serenissima has ever had in the FIFA world rankings was world No. 118 in September 1993 and it has been a steady descent – with some precipitous falls – since then. The last time the team was not rock bottom of the rankings was more than three years ago when, for 35 days, the side was 209th instead of 210th.

Why this mischievous 95-year-old is messing with Mickey Mouse,"In a new show at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), the zany work of a nonagenarian ceramicist with a mischievous eye delivers a refreshing twist on traditions in pottery. Magdalena Suarez Frimkess is an anarchic cartoonist in clay: in a career spanning more than half a century, the Venezuelan-born artist has created everyday objects decorated with irreverent images of Mickey Mouse (running around the rim of a soup bowl), Donald Duck (looking guilty), and Olive Oyl (being thrown to the sharks). In 2015, she made a full tea set featuring Looney Tunes’ demented Tasmanian Devil. “Magdalena Suarez Frimkess: The Finest Disregard” finds the artist enjoying her first major solo show at the tender age of 95. Suarez Frimkess — who lives near Venice Beach in Los Angeles with her husband, the celebrated American potter Michael Frimkess — has riffed on popular American iconography, from Betty Boop and Bugs Bunny to Wonder Woman and Felix the Cat, as well as Chilean comic characters, such as Condorito the anthropomorphic condor.

These hyperreal drawings of trucks look just like photographs – and take up to 500 hours to make,"Andrew Holmes’ images of trucks on Californian highways are sun-drenched, saturated and sharp. Looking at the crystal clear snapshots, you can almost hear the roar of the engines, feel the heat reflected off shiny aluminum gas tanks, and smell the diesel pumped out of the exhausts. But these are not photographs: each hyperreal image is in fact a color pencil drawing, resulting from between 300 and 500 hours of careful construction. Now, Holmes’ works have been brought together in a book — “Gas Tank City” (Circa Press) — alongside a show of the same name at London’s Architectural Association (AA). Holmes trained as an architect: he attended the AA, and even worked with the late Richard Rogers in 1969, on designs for the Centre Pompidou in Paris. But Holmes has since made his name as a multimedia artist, who by his own admission has been dedicated to drawing since he was four years old. Having grown up in the English town of Bromsgrove, Holmes traveled to the US as a student, at first snapping photographs and drawing what he saw in New York City, before heading out to Los Angeles and southern California. He became entranced by the Interstate Highway System: “I discovered (it) was designed as a single object,” he explained over coffee in London. “It (was) 43,000 miles long (at the time of its original design in 1956) — the biggest object that’s ever been designed in the world.” In California, Holmes regularly got in his car and drove along the highways. This was the early 1970s. “In those days, driving was actually a pleasure,” he said, contrasting it to the increased traffic of more recent years. He would visit truck stops and simply observe: the gas stations, the vehicles, the roadside diners and their signs. Something about them reminded him of visiting the local train station as a child in England, and watching “these huge things belching steam” pull into the station. What he loves about trucks is a similar sensory overload: “The sound, the smell, the shiny aluminum, the size of the things.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/25/style/andrew-holmes-truck-drawings-gas-tank/index.html,CNN,2024-09-30
WADA appeals decision that cleared world No. 1 tennis player Jannik Sinner after he tested positive for a banned substance,"The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) says it’s lodging an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after an independent tribunal found world No. 1 tennis player Jannik Sinner wasn’t at fault for twice testing positive for a banned substance in March 2024. Sinner, 23, has so far avoided suspension from competition since the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced in August that he wasn’t at fault despite testing positive for Clostebol, an anabolic steroid. Two samples collected eight days apart at Indian Wells in March showed low levels of the drug. In a statement posted on social media in August, Sinner said the positive tests stemmed from “inadvertent contamination of Clostebol” through treatment from his physiotherapist.

Trump faces limited paths to victory should he fail to hold North Carolina – the state where he earned his slimmest margin of victory in 2020 – and a win in Nebraska’s 2nd District would open up a path for Harris through the northern “blue wall” states even if she fails to carry any of the Sun Belt battlegrounds.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/27/politics/cnn-poll-harris-trump-north-carolina-nebraska/index.html,CNN,2024-09-30

These hyperreal drawings of trucks look just like photographs – and take up to 500 hours to make,"Andrew Holmes’ images of trucks on Californian highways are sun-drenched, saturated and sharp. Looking at the crystal clear snapshots, you can almost hear the roar of the engines, feel the heat reflected off shiny aluminum gas tanks, and smell the diesel pumped out of the exhausts. But these are not photographs: each hyperreal image is in fact a color pencil drawing, resulting from between 300 and 500 hours of careful construction. Now, Holmes’ works have been brought together in a book — “Gas Tank City” (Circa Press) — alongside a show of the same name at London’s Architectural Association (AA). Holmes trained as an architect: he attended the AA, and even worked with the late Richard Rogers in 1969, on designs for the Centre Pompidou in Paris. But Holmes has since made his name as a multimedia artist, who by his own admission has been dedicated to drawing since he was four years old. Having grown up in the English town of Bromsgrove, Holmes traveled to the US as a student, at first snapping photographs and drawing what he saw in New York City, before heading out to Los Angeles and southern California. He became entranced by the Interstate Highway System: “I discovered (it) was designed as a single object,” he explained over coffee in London. “It (was) 43,000 miles long (at the time of its original design in 1956) — the biggest object that’s ever been designed in the world.” In California, Holmes regularly got in his car and drove along the highways. This was the early 1970s. “In those days, driving was actually a pleasure,” he said, contrasting it to the increased traffic of more recent years. He would visit truck stops and simply observe: the gas stations, the vehicles, the roadside diners and their signs. Something about them reminded him of visiting the local train station as a child in England, and watching “these huge things belching steam” pull into the station. What he loves about trucks is a similar sensory overload: “The sound, the smell, the shiny aluminum, the size of the things.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/25/style/andrew-holmes-truck-drawings-gas-tank/index.html,CNN,2024-09-30
